Create an OBJ model of a building, an animal, or a thing using Blender or any 3D modelling program.

Requirements:
Create a short video (or a document with screenshots) showing the modeling process.
The video can have jumps to show very quickly the most important aspects of the model creation.
Export the model to an OBJ file.
